The fallen angel is a headhunter species that hunts down any player.
They can collect headhunter points by killing a player.
Every point collected will improve every spell field until the fallen angel dies.
The maximum number of points is `5` by default, and every point increases any field by `10%`.

For more information on spell fields, visit the spells (work in progress) section.
