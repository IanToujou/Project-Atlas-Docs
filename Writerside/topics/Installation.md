# Installation

<chapter title="About"/>

Project Atlas is a powerful plugin that brings custom spells, species, weapons, abilities and a variety of fantasy
and role-play features into Minecraft. The plugin is currently available and supported for the following software:

<list>
   <li>
      ❌ Bukkit
   </li>
   <li>
      ✅ Spigot
   </li>
   <li>
      ✅ Paper
   </li>
</list>

<warning title="Version Support">
   Project Atlas may work on other software as well, but we will not provide official support and fixes for these
   versions.
</warning>

The plugin needs to run on **Minecraft 1.20.x** or later. Project Atlas uses a lot of new particles, items and sounds
from the newer versions. Older Minecraft versions would make the plugin boring and spells would lose variety.

<chapter title="How to Install"/>

      of your server directory.
   </step>
   <step>
      You can now either <b>reload</b> your server, by typing <code>/reload confirm</code> in the console. Or you can restart the
      server completely.

</procedure>
    
<warning title="Server Reloads">
    We recommend <b>always</b> restarting the server completely, to avoid bugs. Normally, a reload will do the job,
    but we highly advise against it, especially if there are more than 10 players online.
