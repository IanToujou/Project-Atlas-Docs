# Elf

<img src="item_sweet_berries.png" alt="elf_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Elf Icon"/> Elves live deep within the woods. They are specialized in support and healing abilities, and they are a species with many secrets. Because of that, they tend to hide from other species, especially humans.

Selecting the Elf class will grant you a variety of active abilities. You can find more details later on in the <a href="Elements.md"/>section.
