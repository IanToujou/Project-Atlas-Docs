# Introduction

Project Atlas currently features nine different species and many subspecies.
When joining the server, you can select any base species.

At character level 8, you can select a subspecies using the altar.
One of the subspecies is an extension of the base species, which means it has the same passive and key abilities.
The only difference is that the extension will have an additional key ability.
All the other subclasses are variations and unique in their own way.
