# Aquatilia

<img src="icon_aquatilia.png" alt="aquatilia_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Aquatilia Icon"/> Aquatilia are species that only live under the sea. They go very rarely on land, mostly because they cannot survive on it without certain conditions. Aquatilia are more closed off from other species due to their environment.
