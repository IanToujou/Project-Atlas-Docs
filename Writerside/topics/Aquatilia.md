<img src="item_heart_of_the_sea.png" alt="aquatilia_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Aquatilia Icon"/> Aquatilia is a species that only lives under the sea. They go very rarely on land, mostly because they cannot survive on it without certain conditions. Aquatilia are more closed off to other species due to their environment.
