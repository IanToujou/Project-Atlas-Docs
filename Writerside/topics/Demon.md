<img src="item_fire_charge.png" alt="demon_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Demon Icon"/> Demons can live almost everywhere on land, but they prefer to hide under the ground. They build huge fortresses to intimidate their foes. Demons are generally seen as evil and bad individuals.

Selecting the Demon class will grant you a variety of active abilities. You can find more details later on in the <a href="Elements.md"/>section.

<chapter title="Key Ability">

The basic demon species can consume other players by killing them to buff their own max health.
Every kill will add a multiplier of `0.1x` to their max health.
This stacks up to a total multiplier of `2.0x`.
This means that they can consume a total of ten souls.

Demons cannot consume their own souls, and they can only consume any player's soul once.
When the demon dies, they will lose any collected souls and therefore the multiplier.

The demon's bar will change depending on their current multiplier. If the multiplier is above `1.0x`, it will flash.

<chapter title="Subclasses">

The Demon class consists of a variety of different subclasses. One of these
subclasses is an extension of the base class, whereas the other subclasses
are quite different.

Selecting a subclass is only possible at a certain character level.
