<chapter title="Key Ability">

<chapter title="Bloodthirsty Frenzy">

The vampire has a special and unique mana bar.
The bar does not hold normal mana but blood mana.
Blood mana is the life force of every living being and can be extracted from animals or players. 

This mana will not regenerate naturally and must be farmed, but it has a cap that is `3x` that of normal mana.

<img src="graph_vampire_blood_mana.png" alt="graph_vampire_blood_mana" title="Vampire blood mana"/>

When inflicting damage, the blood mana bar will be filled up by an amount equivalent to `10%` of the damage dealt.
For instance, dealing `5` damage to an entity will fill up the blood mana bar by `0.5` mana.
Some entities will not fill the mana bar up at all, such as non-living entities, armor stands, boats, etc.
If the vampire dies, all their blood mana will be lost.

Vampires can also transform into a bat.
This transformation is done by right-clicking a coal block and can be undone by left-clicking in the air.

A vampire bat cannot fly higher than `20` blocks above the ground.
