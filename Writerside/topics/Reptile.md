<img src="reptile_icon.png" alt="reptile_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Reptile Icon"/> Reptiles are commonly found near water or in the desert, depending on the subclass. They are agile and very specialized on their environment. Reptiles rest in caves, but they need the sunlight to gain energy.
