# Angel

<img src="icon_angel.png" alt="angel_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Angel Icon"/> Angels are the opposite of demons. They are associated with being good and helping other species, or at least people who worship them. Some angels though, are corrupted, and they are evil, despite their good nature.
