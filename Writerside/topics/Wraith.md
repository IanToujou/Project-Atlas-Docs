<img src="item_phantom_membrane.png" alt="phantom_membrane" width="32" style="inline" title="Phantom Membrane"/> Wraiths are evil ghosts that possess creepy abilities. They love to pull pranks or even haunt other players.

<tip>This subspecies is an extension of the <img src="item_fire_charge.png" alt="demon_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Demon Icon"/> <a href="Demon.md"/> base species.</tip>

<chapter title="Key Ability">

The wraith is completely invisible in daytime and cannot interact with players or use any spells while invisible.
They can interact with blocks, entities and the world around them, but now with players.
It is theoretically possible to hurt players in this way, but certain block placements are disabled during the day for this reason.

Blocks and items that are disabled during the day include:
Water & lava buckets, TNT, tools to make fire, fireworks, etc.
