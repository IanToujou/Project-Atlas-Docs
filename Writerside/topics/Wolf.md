# Wolf

<img src="wolf_icon.png" alt="wolf_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Wolf Icon"/> Wolves are a race found primarily in cold biomes. They move in a pack. These ice-cold killers use their sense of smell to chase down any prey. In a pack they are true survival artists, but when they are alone their weaknesses come to the fore.
