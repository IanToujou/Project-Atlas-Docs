# Void Walker

<img src="item_ender_pearl.png" alt="ender_pearl" width="32" style="inline" title="Ender Pearl"/> Not every demon was born in hell. The Void Walker, a highly intelligent species, originates from the void. Most Void Walkers are more or less harmless, but you should not mess with one.

<tip>This subspecies is an extension of the <img src="item_fire_charge.png" alt="demon_icon" width="32" style="inline" title="Demon Icon"/> <a href="Demon.md"/> base species.</tip>
