# Elements

Elements are one of the basic mechanics when it comes to spells. At the moment, there are 13 different elements. As shown in the image below, elements are divided into three different groups: Light, Dark and The Pillars of Existence.

<note>
    The three elemental groups only exist to illustrate the concept.

<chapter title="Light">

<img src="title_light.png" alt="title_light" height="128" title="Light Title"/>

> <i>Where there is darkness, let there be light. ~ Francis of Assisi</i>

<format color="Bisque"><img src="element_light.png" alt="icon_light" style="inline" width="20" title="Light Icon"/> Light</format> was the first element since the existence of the universe, along with <format color="Gray"><img src="element_dark.png" alt="icon_dark" style="inline" width="20" title="Dark Icon"/> Dark</format>. It is not good nor evil, it is just the counterpart of the <format color="Gray"><img src="element_dark.png" alt="icon_dark" style="inline" width="20" title="Dark Icon"/> Dark</format> and cannot exist without it. 

When the two great architects were born from nothing, they were both orphans of the void.
Opposites, but yet deeply connected as the first of their kind.
Atlas, architect of <format color="Bisque"><img src="icon_light.png" alt="icon_light" style="inline" width="20" title="Light Icon"/>Light</format>, and Ultris, architect of <format color="Gray"><img src="icon_dark.png" alt="icon_dark" style="inline" width="20" title="Dark Icon"/>Dark</format>, were awakened by a greater power of the unknown.
Every known architect in existence, along with their element, was created by the two great architects.

Most <format color="Bisque"><img src="icon_light.png" alt="icon_light" style="inline" width="20" title="Light Icon"/>Light</format> abilities deal a lot of damage and focus on single targets. Some abilities also provide buffs and support.

</chapter>

<chapter title="Dark">

<img src="title_dark.png" alt="title_dark" height="128" title="Dark Title"/>

> <i>Even the day's last sliver of light must submit to darkness. ~ Angie Weiland-Crosby</i>

<format color="Gray"><img src="element_dark.png" alt="icon_dark" style="inline" width="20" title="Dark Icon"/> Dark</format> is the counterpart to <format color="Bisque"><img src="element_light.png" alt="icon_light" style="inline" width="20" title="Light Icon"/> Light</format> and was created along with it.

The element of darkness is being held by the balance of <format color="Bisque"><img src="icon_light.png" alt="icon_light" style="inline" width="20" title="Light Icon"/>Light</format> and <format color="Gray"><img src="icon_dark.png" alt="icon_dark" style="inline" width="20" title="Dark Icon"/>Dark</format>.
One might mistake darkness for a negative force,
but in reality,
darkness is just the absence of <format color="Bisque"><img src="icon_light.png" alt="icon_light" style="inline" width="20" title="Light Icon"/>Light</format>.
However, it is a power of its own and not just nothing.

<format color="Gray"><img src="element_dark.png" alt="icon_dark" style="inline" width="20" title="Dark Icon"/> Dark</format> abilities are as powerful as light abilities, dealing massive damage. However, instead of focusing on buffs, they focus on debuffs.

<chapter title="Quantum">

<img src="title_quantum.png" alt="title_quantum" height="128" title="Quantum Title"/>

> <i>So much universe and so little time. ~ Terry Pratchett</i>

The first architect
to be created was the architect of <format color="MediumPurple"><img src="icon_quantum.png" alt="icon_quantum" style="inline" width="20" title="Quantum Icon"/>Quantum</format>,
protector of space.

The foundation of the new world was space and time,
and so the great architects created the element of space:
<format color="MediumPurple"><img src="element_quantum.png" alt="icon_quantum" style="inline" width="20" title="Quantum Icon"/> Quantum</format> and the element of time:
<format color="MediumAquamarine"><img src="element_chrono.png" alt="icon_chrono" style="inline" width="20" title="Chrono Icon"/> Chrono</format>.
The new world needed space to hold any potential creations of the great architects.

Abilities of space are very rare, and only a few gifted talents may wield their powers.
They are incredibly powerful and cover a variety of skills.

<chapter title="Chrono">

<img src="title_chrono.png" alt="title_chrono" height="128" title="Chrono Title"/>

> <i>Do not waste time on nonsense. ~ Marcus Aurelius</i>

<format color="MediumAquamarine"><img src="element_chrono.png" alt="icon_chrono" style="inline" width="20" title="Chrono Icon"/> Chrono</format> is the element of time, the second architect created.

Before <format color="MediumAquamarine"><img src="icon_chrono.png" alt="icon_chrono" style="inline" width="20" title="Chrono Icon"/>Chrono</format> was created, only space existed, without any movement. The great architects created the element of time to add a natural dynamic and movement to the universe.

<format color="MediumAquamarine"><img src="element_chrono.png" alt="icon_chrono" style="inline" width="20" title="Chrono Icon"/> Chrono</format> abilities are even rarer than <format color="MediumPurple"><img src="element_quantum.png" alt="icon_quantum" style="inline" width="20" title="Quantum Icon"/> Quantum</format> abilities. No one really knows how to wield this power, and yet it exists.
 
</chapter>

<chapter title="Earth">

<img src="title_earth.png" alt="title_earth" height="128" title="Earth Title"/>

> <i>The earth is what we all have in common. ~ Wendell Berry</i>

The first element
to be created after the <b>Pillars of Existence</b> was <format color="Peru"><img src="icon_earth.png" alt="icon_earth" style="inline" width="20" title="Earth Icon"/>Earth</format>.
The new world needs to hold itself together, and that is why the great architects created this new architect.

<format color="Peru"><img src="element_earth.png" alt="icon_earth" style="inline" width="20" title="Earth Icon"/> Earth</format> is the very element of which most matter is made.
Without <format color="Peru"><img src="element_earth.png" alt="icon_earth" style="inline" width="20" title="Earth Icon"/> Earth</format>, there is only emptiness in the vast universe.
From the finest sand to the hardest minerals,
this element is abundant in every planet, and its colossal power should never be underestimated.

Abilities that are infused with <format color="Peru"><img src="icon_earth.png" alt="icon_earth" style="inline" width="20" title="Earth Icon"/>Earth</format> are mostly defensive.
However, the colossal forces created by rocks can output quite the damage.

</chapter>

<chapter title="Air">

<img src="title_air.png" alt="title_air" height="128" title="Air Title"/>

> <i>Still, like air, I rise ~ Maya Angelou</i>

<format color="LightBlue"><img src="element_air.png" alt="icon_air" style="inline" width="20" title="Air Icon"/> Air</format> is the element that holds the force of the atmosphere and wind.

Floating rocks in space are cool and everything, but there is no movement on the surface.
And so the architect of <format color="LightBlue"><img src="icon_air.png" alt="icon_air" style="inline" width="20" title="Air Icon"/>Air</format> was created,
to fill the gap between planets and empty space.
This air should serve as a border and contrast the ground and the sky.

<format color="LightBlue"><img src="element_air.png" alt="icon_air" style="inline" width="20" title="Air Icon"/> Air</format> abilities focus on movement, attracting and repelling objects.

</chapter>

<chapter title="Fire">

<img src="title_fire.png" alt="title_fire" height="128" title="Fire Title"/>

> <i>Every act of creation is first an act of destruction. ~ Pablo Picasso</i>

The <format color="IndianRed"><img src="icon_fire.png" alt="icon_fire" style="inline" width="20" title="Fire Icon"/>Fire</format> element is one and the first of the five dark elements. Generally seen as a symbol of destruction, fire is as essential to the world as every other element.

During the <b>Great Convergence</b>, the architects realized they need to balance creation and destruction.
To make place for the new, you must first destroy, and so, from the ashes of the old shall rise the new.
One might be concerned about the fact that destruction can bring harm to the new world. But even so, in the end, it is just the destiny of all things, to be destroyed eventually, to make place for change.

These abilities are all destructive and deal massive damage.
Only very few architects possess the ability
to cast <format color="IndianRed"><img src="icon_fire.png" alt="icon_fire" style="inline" width="20" title="Fire Icon"/>Fire</format> abilities that restore health or mana.

<chapter title="Water">

<img src="title_water.png" alt="title_water" height="128" title="Water Title"/>

> <i>Be like water, my friend. ~ Bruce Lee</i>

<format color="Aqua"><img src="element_water.png" alt="icon_water" style="inline" width="20" title="Water Icon"/> Water</format> is the basic element from which all life is made.
As much as <format color="IndianRed"><img src="element_fire.png" alt="icon_fire" style="inline" width="20" title="Fire Icon"/> Fire</format> is the element of destruction. <format color="Aqua"><img src="element_water.png" alt="icon_water" style="inline" width="20" title="Water Icon"/> Water</format> is the element of creation.

Now that a destructive force,
the <format color="IndianRed"><img src="icon_fire.png" alt="icon_fire" style="inline" width="20" title="Fire Icon"/>Fire</format> element,
flows through the new world,
the architects created a force of the opposite: Creation.
They created the element of <format color="Aqua"><img src="icon_water.png" alt="icon_water" style="inline" width="20" title="Water Icon"/>Water</format>,
capable of constructing life.

<format color="Aqua"><img src="element_water.png" alt="icon_water" style="inline" width="20" title="Water Icon"/> Water</format> abilities focus on healing and buffs, although some of them also do damage.

<chapter title="Flora">

<img src="title_flora.png" alt="title_flora" height="128" title="Flora Title"/>

> <i>There's no way that you can stop nature. ~ Luis Negron</i>

<format color="GreenYellow"><img src="element_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/> Flora</format> is the element of nature. It is present almost everywhere in the world, no matter if in the woods, plains, ocean and even underground! It is no surprise that Flora is essential for the ecosystem and life.

The new world created by the architects was full of dynamics, but it lacked life.
And so they created the <format color="GreenYellow"><img src="icon_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/>Flora</format> element along with its architect.
The new element finally brought life to the new world, and all kinds of species started to live in it.
<format color="GreenYellow"><img src="element_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/> Flora</format> itself has the energy to create live out of dead matter, but only one being,
the architect of <format color="GreenYellow"><img src="element_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/> Flora</format>, has the power to imbue the lifeless with life.

Abilities that use the <format color="GreenYellow"><img src="icon_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/>Flora</format> element are often imbued with life and healing capabilities.
However, the destructive power of nature should never be underestimated.

<chapter title="Fairy">

<img src="title_fairy.png" alt="title_fairy" height="128" title="Fairy Title"/>

> <i>Those who do not believe in magic will never find it. ~ Roald Dahl</i>

<format color="DeepPink"><img src="element_fairy.png" alt="icon_fairy" style="inline" width="20" title="Fairy Icon"/> Fairy</format> is the element of magic itself. It is an extension of the <format color="GreenYellow"><img src="element_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/> Flora</format> element.

The <format color="GreenYellow"><img src="icon_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/>Flora</format> architect got bored with the element alone
and asked the great architects
to create an additional element to <format color="GreenYellow"><img src="icon_flora.png" alt="icon_flora" style="inline" width="20" title="Flora Icon"/>Flora</format>.
They created the architect of <format color="DeepPink"><img src="icon_fairy.png" alt="icon_fairy" style="inline" width="20" title="Fairy Icon"/>Fairy</format>, that should imbue magic into the creatures on the world.

The Abilities of the <format color="DeepPink"><img src="icon_fairy.png" alt="icon_fairy" style="inline" width="20" title="Fairy Icon"/>Fairy</format> element provide strong buffs and even stronger healing capabilities.

<chapter title="Psychic">

<img src="title_psychic.png" alt="title_psychic" height="128" title="Psychic Title"/>

> <i>Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know. ~ Ernest Hemingway</i>

<format color="SlateBlue"><img src="element_psychic.png" alt="icon_psychic" style="inline" width="20" title="Psychic Icon"/> Psychic</format> is the element of that, which exists beyond the material form.

The mind of the living was too empty, the architects thought.
And so they created something beyond the material existence.
And thus,
the <format color="SlateBlue"><img src="icon_psychic.png" alt="icon_psychic" style="inline" width="20" title="Psychic Icon"/>Psychic</format> architect was born.
Between the architects, small wars broke out.
These battles, however, were not fought with the flesh, but rather with their minds.

<format color="SlateBlue"><img src="element_psychic.png" alt="icon_psychic" style="inline" width="20" title="Psychic Icon"/> Psychic</format> abilities are not yet fully understood, but they provide buffs and debuffs to a creature's mind.

<chapter title="Electro">

<img src="title_electro.png" alt="title_electro" height="128" title="Electro Title"/>

> <i>If your hate could be turned into electricity, it would light up the whole world. ~ Nikola Tesla</i>

<format color="Yellow"><img src="element_electro.png" alt="icon_electro" style="inline" width="20" title="Electro Icon"/> Electro</format> is the element of a very powerful natural force that flows through the sky and earth.

<format color="Yellow"><img src="element_electro.png" alt="icon_electro" style="inline" width="20" title="Electro Icon"/> Electro</format> was not created because of a mere idea of the great architects.
The architect of electro was created without any power from above,
but rather by the interactions between the living and the dead.

Abilities with the element of <format color="Yellow"><img src="icon_electro.png" alt="icon_electro" style="inline" width="20" title="Electro Icon"/>Electro</format> are generally known
to buff users or to stun enemies.

</chapter>

<chapter title="Normal">

<img src="title_normal.png" alt="title_normal" height="128" title="Normal Title"/>

> <i>Normality is a fine ideal for those who have no imagination. ~ Carl Jung</i>

<format color="LightSlateGray"><img src="element_normal.png" alt="icon_normal" style="inline" width="20" title="Normal Icon"/> Normal</format> is the element of neutrality. It is not nothing, nor everything mixed. It is a line between all the elements, and it can take all shapes and forms.

The architects needed something perfectly neutral and equal to be created.
An element to fill the void and blur the lines between forces.
They created the architect of <format color="LightSlateGray"><img src="icon_normal.png" alt="icon_normal" style="inline" width="20" title="Normal Icon"/>Normal</format>.

<format color="LightSlateGray"><img src="element_normal.png" alt="icon_normal" style="inline" width="20" title="Normal Icon"/> Normal</format> abilities come in all variations; some do damage, some do not.
